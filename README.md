## Aerospike Loader Community Development
Aerospike Loader has been turned over to the community. If you wish to contribute code, go ahead and clone this repo, modify the code, and create a pull request. Active contributors can then ask to become maintainers for the repo. The wiki can similarly be modified by any code contributor who has been granted pull permissions.

As described on the [Product Stages](https://aerospike.com/docs/database/reference/product-stages#open-source-products-tools-and-libraries) page, this means that Aerospike will no longer provide support for Aerospike Loader, including vulnerability patching. 


<a name="Prerequisites"></a>
## Prerequisites
* Java 1.8 or greater
* Maven 3.0 or greater

<a name="Installation"></a>
## Installation
* Source code is available on github:

        $ git clone https://github.com/aerospike/aerospike-loader.git

* Then build the utility by running following:

        $ cd aerospike-loader
        $ ./build


<a name="Usage"></a>
## Usage

If you downloaded the jar from [the releases page](https://github.com/aerospike/aerospike-loader/releases). Use

        $ java -cp aerospike-load-*-jar-with-dependencies.jar com.aerospike.load.AerospikeLoad <options> <data file name(s)/directory>

If you downloaded the source. Use **run_loader** script along with options and data files.  
    
        $ ./run_loader <options> <data file name(s)/directory>

"data file name(s)/directory" can either be space delimited files or a directory name containing data files. See "Data Files" section for more details.

For available options and their descriptions run with asloader's --usage option.

        $ java -cp aerospike-load-*-jar-with-dependencies.jar com.aerospike.load.AerospikeLoad --usage
        $ ./run_loader --usage

For more details, refer to [Options](https://aerospike.com/docs/tools/asloader/options).

### Some extra info about internal working:

* There are 2 types of threads:
    * reader threads (reads CSV files) (The number of reader threads = either number of CPUs or number of files in the directory, whichever one is lower.)
    * writer threads (writes to the cluster) (The number of writer threads = number of CPUs * 5 (5 is scaleFactor))

### Sample usage of common options:

        $ ./run_loader -h nodex -p 3000 -n test -T 3000 -e 2592000 -ec 100 -tz PST -wa update -c ~/pathto/config.json datafiles/

Where:

```
Server IP:                                  nodex (-h)
Port:                                       3000 (-p)
Namespace:                                  test (-n) 
Write Operation Timeout (in milliseconds):  3000 (-T)
Write Error Threshold:                      100 (-ec)
Record Expiration:                          2592000 (-e)
Timezone:                                   PST (-tz)
Write Action:                               update (-wa) 
Data Mapping:                               ~/pathto/config.json (-c)
Data Files:                                 datafiles/
```

<a name="demoexample"></a>
## Demo example
Example directory contains two files: allDatatype.json and data.csv. Run the following command to load data from data file data.csv.

    ./run_loader -h localhost -c example/alldatatype.json example/alldatatype.dsv
